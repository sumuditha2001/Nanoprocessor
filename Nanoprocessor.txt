We designed our display(with LUT) to represent  the negative numbers.
For an example if the answer we have to represent is neagatie seven, we designed the seven segment to represent number seven and we mapped a LED to light up to indicate it as a negative number.
The corresponding LED which lights up if the answer is a negative is LED 10.


inputs   :-  Reset     -  btnC ( U18 )

outputs  :-  Zero      -  LED 14 ( P1 )
	     Negative  -  LED 10 ( W3 )
	     Overflow  -  LED 15 ( L1 )

	     Output    -  LED 0 (U16) , LED 1 (E19) , LED 2 (U19) , LED 3 (V19)
